# SwitchRoot-Q-Overclock
**WARNING!**<br />
**OVERCLOCKING TO 2.09ghz ACCELERATES BATTERY DEGRADATION GREATLY**
**LIKE OTHER OC SCENARIOS, THIS WILL DEGRADE YOUR CPU FASTER**

## Introduction
**This repository contains a TWRP flashable zip that has an overclocked boot.img and an edited power profile to enable a 2.09ghz overclock.**<br />
**2091 OC - May 10th.zip** is for the **May 10th** SwitchRoot Android 10 Build<br />
**2091 OC - Aug 12th-dev.zip** is for the **August 12th** SwitchRoot Android 10 Dev Build<br />

[**SwitchRoot Dev Builds**](https://gitlab.com/switchroot/android/manifest/-/pipelines?scope=finished&page=1)<br />
**USE DEV BUILDS WITH CAUTION - BUILDS MAY BE BROKEN OR HAVE CRIPPLING ISSUES THAT MAY CAUSE LOSS OF DATA OR FUNCTION**

2091 OC will overclock in both handheld and dock. Earlier Dock Only zips no longer work...

## Installation
1. Flash `2091 OC*.zip`in TWRP
2. Boot switchroot, enable Performance Mode & enjoy your overclock!
(Settings > System > Advanced > Display and Performance Configuration > Performance Mode)

If you haven't already flashed [**Magisk**](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases) & want root, you can flash it after flashing this!
